        Pokémon[a] is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and
        published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company under the Pokémon media
        franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,
        the first games, Pocket Monsters Red and Green, released in 1996 in
        Japan for the Game Boy, later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red
        and Blue. The main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), referred
        as the core series by their developers,[1][2][3] have continued on each
        generation of Nintendo handhelds. The most recently released core series
        game, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, was released on January 28, 2022, for the
        Nintendo Switch. It is a prequel to the 2006 Nintendo DS games Pokémon
        Diamond and Pearl. The core games are released in generations, each with
        different Pokémon, storylines, and characters. Remakes of the games are
        usually released around a decade after the original versions for the
        latest console at the time. While the main series consists of RPGs
        developed by Game Freak, many spin-off games based on the series have
        been developed by various companies, encompassing other genres such as
        action role-playing, puzzle, fighting, and digital pet games..
